Reasons for late git calls
>>>>All of our files were on github, but due to miscommunication, and unfamiliarity of a teammate with github, our main branch got messed up. A very important page was in one of the imcomplete branches. So we commited from that branch and pushed to main. However, Ryan, very thankful to him for his lenience on the matter, told me I had to do it real quick. In that hurry, we commited and pushed the wrong file, resulting in us ruining another important functionality, which I fixed on the spot in github ide, commited and pushed.
>>>>Thank you for that little bit of time, it saved our project.
